# Rainfall-Prediction-in-Australia and Object-localization-using-Pytorch
Object-localization-using-Pytorch: In this project, we are using EfficientNet-B0 as a pretraining model.
Rainfall-Prediction-in-Australia : Evaluated models (Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, SVM) using Accuracy, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, LogLoss, MAE, MSE, and R2.
